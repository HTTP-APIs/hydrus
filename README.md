hydrus [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/HTTP-APIs/hydrus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/HTTP-APIs/hydrus)
===================
hydrus is a set of **Python**-based tools for easier and more efficient creation of Hypermedia driven REST-APIs. hydrus utilises the power of [Linked Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) to create powerful REST APIs to serve data.
hydrus uses the [Hydra(W3C)](http://www.hydra-cg.com/) standard for creation and documentation of its APIs.

Start-up the demo
-----------------
* with *Docker* and *docker-compose* installed, run `docker-compose up --build`
* open the browser at `http://localhost:8000/api/vocab`

You should be displaying the example API as served by the server.

Add your own Hydra documentation file
-------------------------------------
To serve your own Hydra-RDF documentation file:
* create a `doc.py` file as the ones in `examples/` directory containing your own *ApiDoc*
* set the `APIDOC_REL_PATH` variable in `docker-compose.yml`. This should the relative path from the project root
* start-up the demo as above.

You should be displaying your API as served by the server.

Features
-------------
hydrus supports the following features:
- Be a client that understands Hydra vocabulary and performs basic [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations on data in a Hydra supporting server. 
- Be a generic server that provides the required data and metadata (in the form of API documentation) to a client over HTTP.
- Be a middleware that allows users to interact with the server using Natural Language which is a processed machine consumable language. **(under development)**

<a name="req"></a>
Requirements
-------------
The system is built over the following standards and tools:
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), a Python-based micro-framework for handling server requests and responses.
- [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/) as the preferred data format.
- [Hydra](http://www.hydra-cg.com/) as the API standard.
- [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) as the backend database connector for storage and related operations.

Other than this, there are also various Python packages that hydrus uses. Running `python setup.py install` installs all the required dependencies.

**NOTE:** `python3` should be used, not `python2`.

Demo
-------------
To run a demo for hydrus using the sample API, do the following:

Clone hydrus:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HTTP-APIs/hydrus
```
Change directory and switch to the develop branch:
```bash
cd hydrus

git checkout -b develop origin/develop
```

Install hydrus:
```bash
pip install .
```
or
```bash
python setup.py install
```

and run the server:

```bash
hydrus serve
```

The demo should now be running on `http://localhost:8080/serverapi/`.
