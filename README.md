Hydrus
===================
Hydrus is a set of **Python** based tools for easier and efficient creation of Hypermedia driven REST-APIs. Hydrus utilises the power of [Linked Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) to create a powerful REST APIs to serve data. 
Hydrus uses the [Hydra(W3C)](http://www.hydra-cg.com/) standard for creation and documentation of it's APIs.

Features
-------------
Hydrus supports the following features:
- A client that can understand Hydra vocabulary and interacts with a Hydra supporting server to basic [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations on data.
- A generic server that can serve required data and metadata(in the form of API documentation) to a client over HTTP.
- A middleware that allows users to use the client to interact with the server using Natural Language which is processed machine consumable language. **(under developement)**

Requirements
-------------
The system is built over the following standards and tools:
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) a Python based micro-framework for handling server requests and responses.
- [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/) as the prefered data format.
- [Hydra](http://www.hydra-cg.com/) as the API standard.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the backend database for storage and CRUD operations.

Apart from this, there are also various Python packages that Hydrus uses. A list of all these packages can be found in the [requirements](requirements.txt) file. It would be advisable to run **`pip install -r requirements.txt`** before setting up other things.
