### How is an ```ApiDoc``` defined:
- There are two ways of defining an ApiDoc:
  1. Writing a Hydra-compliant JSON-LD like [here]( https://github.com/HTTP-APIs/hydrus/blob/master/hydrus/samples/doc_writer_sample_output.py)
  1. Defining the ApiDoc programmatically using the code like in [here](https://github.com/HTTP-APIs/hydrus/blob/master/hydrus/samples/doc_writer_sample.py)
- Any valid ApiDoc can be passed to the server so that it can parse the doc, generate a database and start the server.
- The document containing the context is generated by the doc_maker file in the hydra_python_core repo. hydrus provides the link in its response for the context.    


### Points :
#### Description of some files:
1. hydrus/app.py
   1. Used for logging. (Line 22)
   1. Starts the SQLAlchemy engine and creates a session (Line 25-26)
   1. Creates an Api Documentation using the doc_maker() of hydra_python_core
   1. Gets the parsed classes from hydrus/data/doc_parse.py
   1. Creates database tables and its metadata Line 34-36
   1. Checks if Authentication is True, adds user  to the session.Check: https://www.hydraecosystem.org/Auth   
   1. Calls app_factory class' constructor
   1.Sets authentication,api_name,session etc. which can be later retrieved using the corresponding get functions.
   1. Runs the API on the Port mentioned.
1. hydrus/app_factory.py
   1. Used to add resources to the API from resources.py.
   1. Configures properties of API.
   1. Enables CORS
1. hydrus/resources.py
   1. Contains classes which are added as resources to the API.

1. hydrus/samples/hydra_doc_sample.py
   1. This file contains the sample ApiDoc that is displayed when the demo for hydrus is run. It contains the JSON-LD document that is displayed.
