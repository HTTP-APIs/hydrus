### Contribution Best Practices

* Read this [how-to about Github workflow here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) if you are not familiar with.

* Read all the texts related to [contributing for an OS community](https://github.com/HTTP-APIs/hydrus/tree/master/.github).

* Read this [how-to about writing a PR](https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request) and this [other how-to about writing a issue](https://wiredcraft.com/blog/how-we-write-our-github-issues/)

* **first ask in chat**: if you find a problem, first ask for [help in the chat](https://gitter.im/HTTP-APIs/Lobby), then consider opening a issue.
    
* **read history**: before opening a PR be sure that all the tests pass successfully. If any is failing for non-related reasons, annotate the test failure in the PR comment.

* **PRs on develop**: any change should be PRed first in `develop`, `master` can only receive merge from develop.

* **testing**:  everything should work and be tested for Python 3.5.2 and above.
    
* **free PR**: no permission is needed to work on the code. Fork `master`, submit a PR and ask for reviewing. PR is the natural place for code comparison and corrections. If many contributors have something ready in a PR, we can consider opening a branch in which different people working on the same part of the application can collaborate.

* **pylint**: code in PRs should be accurately compliant with [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), checking code with `pylint` is fine.

* **mypy**: every module is and should in future provide type annotations using `mypy`.
